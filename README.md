##Why we are Afraid: Data Page(s)
  Repository for the page(s) which will draw data from whyweareafraid's tumblr page, process, and display it. What this will look like is TBD. Some focuses are tag crunching (how should we sort/categorize?) and pairing instances of harassment with actionable ways to deal with it.

__Possible Formats__

* Write features straight into the tumblr page (though tumblr may not be the best platform for this). 
* Use a Github Page to process and store the tag data.
* Use a Heroku account to regularly pull data from tumblr tags, and give to a Github page for processing (Any input on if/how this is viable would be lovely). 

Thank you [adampowers](https://github.com/adampowers), and all involved so far for the direction, input, work, and many of the words above. Contact [Schmitty](https://github.com/sumnonpuella) with requests/questions for this repository.
